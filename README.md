# Reminder of the issue to be solved
-------------------------------------
Consumers increasingly want their purchasing behavior to reflect their values — such as environmental sustainability, ethical labor, or governance standards. However, visibility into who benefits from sales proceeds, and whether those actors align with consumer values, remains limited.
# This creates information asymmetry between companies and consumers.******

--------------------------------------------------
  Input variables (features):
      - Categorical: sector, country of operation, certifications, flagged controversies (yes/no).
      - Textual: ESG reports, NGO/journalistic articles, social media mentions.
      - Numerical: CO₂ emissions, % renewable energy, gender balance metrics, labor costs, supply chain risk scores.
  Output variable (target): A value alignment score or class label — e.g.:
      - Binary: aligned / not aligned.
      - Multi-class: high / medium / low alignment with given consumer values.
      - Continuous: weighted alignment score (0–1 or 0–100) 
      - Probably all three target depending on result finesse expected
